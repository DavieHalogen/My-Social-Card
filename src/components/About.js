        <p>
           I’m passionate about technology and programming, with a focus on backend development and server management. I enjoy working with tools like MariaDB, Apache, PHP, and Node.js, often using environments like Termux for flexibility. I have a keen interest in creating functional web applications, including e-commerce solutions and chatbot integrations. Outside of coding, I’m an avid gamer who enjoys playing PUBG Mobile and eFootball to relax and stay competitive.
