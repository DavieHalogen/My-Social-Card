            Iâ€™m deeply interested in full-stack development, particularly creating web applications that involve user authentication, CRUD operations, and admin functionalities. I enjoy working on automation and chatbot projects, recently diving into WhatsApp bots using the Baileys library. Gaming is also a big part of my life, especially PUBG Mobile and eFootball, which help me unwind and fuel my creativity. Whether it's experimenting with new technologies or developing APIs, I love exploring different tools to enhance both my projects and gaming experience.
